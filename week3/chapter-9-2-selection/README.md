    <h2>Selection</h2>
    <h3>What?</h3>
    <pre>
        There are a number of applications in which we are interested in identifying a single
        element in terms of its rank relative to an ordering of the entire set.
    </pre>
    Examples include indentifying the:
    <ul>
        <li>minimum and maximum elements</li>
        <li><strong>median</strong> element, that is, the element such that half
        of the other elements are smaller and the remaining half are larger.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
        <h4>The Selection Problem</h4>

    </pre>
