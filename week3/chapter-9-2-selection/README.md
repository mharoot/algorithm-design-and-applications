    <h3>What?</h3>
    <pre>
        <h4>
        There are a number of applications in which we are interested in identifying a single
        element in terms of its rank relative to an ordering of the entire set.
        </h4>
    </pre>
        Examples include indentifying the:
        <ul>
            <li>minimum and maximum elements</li>
            <li><strong>median</strong> element, that is, the element such that half
            of the other elements are smaller and the remaining half are larger.
            </li>
        </ul>
</div>
